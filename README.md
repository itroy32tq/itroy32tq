# **Hello! My name is Evgeniy.** 

### About me:
Since June 2021 in the field of GameDev => I have practical experience working as a technical designer at Awem.
In 2022, I began studying C# and the Unity engine on my own. In July 2023, I completed the educational project "Game Developer on Unity".

## Brief table of contents of the repository
- [Test task for the vacancy Unity developer (trainee/trainee) for the company StemBY LLC](https://github.com/itroy32tq/StamByTest). The first full experience of working with the Photon module and organizing multiplayer. Additionally, experience was gained integration and use of Spine Unity Runtime, creation of virtual joysticks for mobile devices.
- [Test task for the vacancy Unity developer (trainee/trainee) for the company OpenMyGame](https://github.com/itroy32tq/OpenMyGameTes). There's not much Unity involved here, it's mostly resource loading and json deserialization. The rest are programming tasks: working with collections, regular expressions, linked list, etc. Overall, I really liked it.
- [Diploma project in Netology](https://github.com/itroy32tq/Poker-Prototyp). Many solutions may not be the best. However, I managed to implement an AI that independently makes decisions and calculates the strength of its combination
